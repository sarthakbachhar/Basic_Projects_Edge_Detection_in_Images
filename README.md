# Edge Detection with Canny Algorithm

This project demonstrates edge detection using the Canny algorithm in Python, applied to grayscale images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib

## Usage

1. Place your image file in the specified path or update the image path in the code.
2. Run the script to apply the Canny edge detection algorithm and visualize both the original and processed images.

## Example

The script loads a grayscale image, applies the Canny algorithm with specified thresholds, and displays both the original and edge-detected images side by side.
